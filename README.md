# Pareto-chart
Developed by the Italian engineer Vilfredo Pareto, the chart provides a graphic representation of the Pareto principle, a theory maintaining that 80% of the output in a given system is produced by 20% of the input (i.e. defects, mistakes, errors). The chart aims to identify the vital few (~20%) inputs from the insignificant many (~80%).
